            <h3>Everything about ecology</h3>
            <p>
                Ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisms, including humans, and their physical
                environment. It seeks to understand the vital connections between plants and animals and the world
                around
                them. Ecology also provides information about the benefits of ecosystems and how we can use Earth’s
                resources in ways that leave the environment healthy for future generations.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Who are ecologists</h4>
            <p>
                Ecologists study these relationships among organisms and habitats of many different sizes, ranging from
                the
                study of microscopic bacteria growing in a fish tank, to the complex interactions between the thousands
                of
                plant, animal, and other communities found in a desert.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ecologists also study many kinds of environments. For example, ecologists may study microbes living in
                the
                soil under your feet or animals and plants in a rain forest or the ocean. In order to research the
                environment, scientists ask questions, such as: How do organisms interact with the living and nonliving
                factors around them? What do organisms need to survive and thrive in their current environments? To find
                the answers to these questions, ecologists must study and observe all forms of life and their ecosystems
                throughout our world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>The Role of Ecology in Our Lives</h4>
            <p>
                The many specialties within ecology, such as marine, vegetation, and statistical ecology, provide us
                with
                information to better understand the world around us. This information also can help us improve our
                environment, manage our natural resources, and protect human health. The following examples illustrate
                just a few of the ways that ecological knowledge has positively influenced our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1960s, ecological research identified two of the major causes of poor water quality in lakes and
                streams-phosphorous and nitrogen-which were found in large amounts in laundry detergents and
                fertilizers. Provided with this information, citizens were able to take the necessary steps to help
                restore their communities’ lakes and streams-many of which are once again popular for fishing and
                swimming.

            <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
            <p>
                Biodiversity is all the different kinds of life you’ll find in one area—the variety of animals, plants,
                fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world. Each of these species and
                organisms work together in ecosystems, like an intricate web, to maintain balance and support life.
                Biodiversity supports everything in nature that we need to survive: food, clean water, medicine, and
                shelter.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as humans put increasing pressure on the planet, using and consuming more resources than ever
                before,
                we risk upsetting the balance of ecosystems and losing biodiversity.WWF’s 2022 Living Planet Report
                found an average 69% decline in global populations of mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians
                since 1970. The 2019 landmark Global Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity
                and Ecosystem Services reported 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with
                extinction—the highest number in human history.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Threats to biodiversity</h4>
            <p>
                Before the industrial revolution, ecology was characterized by stability. Within each habitat,
                ecosystems
                had been assembled by long-term evolutionary processes where predators and prey, collaborators and
                competitors, from microbes to mammals co-existed within complex, inter-connected webs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Change in biodiversity – the mix of plants, animals, fungi and microscopic organisms living within each
                habitat – occurred but was largely driven by long-term processes happening over centuries to millennia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Human activity, such as burning fossil fuels and industrialized farming, have combined to dramatically
                impact the planet’s biomes and ecosystems. Climate change, deforestation, and pollution have destroyed
                or damaged habitats, changed where species live and eliminated species at a speed and scale comparable
                to major extinction events of the past.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Habitat loss</h4>
            <p>
                Industrialized farming methods have seen the cultivation of single crops, known as ‘monoculture’, and
                the rearing of livestock on a massive scale. This has been, and still is, justified as essential to
                feeding the expanding human population and delivering more affordable and safer food supplies.
            </p>
            <p>
                But industrialized agriculture has enormous impact on biodiversity and human health. Instead of wild
                animals, a small number of farmed animal species – mainly cows and pigs – now dominate. Together they
                account for 60 per cent of all mammal species by mass, compared to four per cent for wild mammals and 36
                per cent for humans. Farmed chickens now account for 57 per cent of all bird species by mass, whereas
                wild birds make up 29 per cent of the total.

            <h3>Climate change</h3>
            <p>
                Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be
                natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human
                activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels
                like coal, oil and gas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the
                Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come
                from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and
                cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major
                sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among
                the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Increase in global warming</h4>
            <p>
                In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global
                temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a
                livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to a 3°C temperature rise by the end of the
                century.
            </p>
            <p>
                The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some
                countries produce much more than others.The seven biggest emitters alone (China, the United States of
                America, India, the European Union, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Brazil) accounted for about
                half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.
                <br>
                Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater
                responsibility to act first.
